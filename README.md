Robot Live is debbuging software for FIRST Tech Challenge and other java applications.

## Tutorial

There are two parts to the Robot Live software: The phone formatting and sending the data to the server and the server which saves the data and hosts the website.

### Server

To install the server onto a computer download the repository. Put it in a folder that is easy to access bacause everytime you start or stop the server you need to get to the files.

To start the server go into the "bin" folder and run the file called "startup.bat".

To stop the server go into the "bin" folder and run the file called "shutdown.bat". Just closing the window does not stop the server. 

### Phone

Infomation about using the phone is found in the [info](/info/README.md) folder.
