Robot Live is debbuging software for FIRST Tech Challenge and other java applications.

# Tutorial

There are two parts to the Robot Live software: The phone formatting and sending the data to the server and the server which saves the data and hosts the website.

## Server

#### Install

To install the server onto a computer download the repository. Put it in a folder that is easy to access bacause everytime you start or stop the server you need to get to the files.

#### Starting

To start the server go into the "bin" folder and run the file called "startup.bat".

#### Testing

To access the website you can type "localhost" into you web browser. If you want to access the website from another computer go to command prompt. Type in "ipconfig" and look for your "IPv4 address". Type this into a browser on another computer to access the website.

#### Stopping

To stop the server go into the "bin" folder and run the file called "shutdown.bat". Just closing the window does not stop the server. 

#### Unistalling

To unistall the program just delete the folder after you stop the server. Running the unistaller is not needed.

## Phone

Infomation about using the phone is found in the [info](/info/README.md) folder.
